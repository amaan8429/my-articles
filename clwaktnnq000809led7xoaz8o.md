Let's delve into some core concepts in Rust that distinguish its memory management from languages like C. We'll explore three approaches to memory management: garbage collection, manual management, and the Rust way. We'll understand what sets Rust apart and why it's exceptionally safe.

But before diving into Rust-specific concepts, let's establish a general understanding of memory management and the significance of memory in computing. When acquiring a computer, one typically considers the processor type, number of cores, hard drive space, and RAM (Random Access Memory). RAM is vital because it stores data for currently running programs. For instance, the browser you're using stores variables and data in RAM for quick access during execution.

Now, let's look at how memory management happens in three different paradigms: garbage collection, manual management, and Rust's approach.

**1\. Garbage Collection:** Languages like JavaScript and Java employ garbage collection for memory management. In this approach, the runtime environment automatically deallocates memory when data is no longer needed. Developers don't directly manage memory; instead, a garbage collector periodically sweeps through memory, reclaiming space occupied by unused data. This automatic process minimises memory-related issues like dangling pointers or memory leaks, making these languages simpler to write and less prone to runtime errors.

**2\. Manual Memory Management:** Contrary to garbage collection, languages like C provide direct control over memory allocation and deallocation. Developers can allocate memory as needed using functions like `malloc` and free it explicitly using `free`. While manual management offers flexibility, it's error-prone and can lead to issues like dangling pointers, buffer overflows, and memory leaks. This approach requires a steep learning curve and meticulous attention to memory-related details.

**3\. The Rust Way:** Rust combines the flexibility of manual memory management with the safety of garbage-collected languages through its ownership model. Rust allows developers to manage memory manually, but with strict rules enforced by the compiler to prevent common memory-related errors at compile time. This ownership model ensures memory safety without relying on a garbage collector, resulting in fast and efficient code.

Rust's approach to memory management prioritizes safety and efficiency without sacrificing performance. By enforcing strict rules at compile time, Rust prevents many common memory-related errors, making it a compelling choice for systems programming where reliability and performance are paramount.

Memory management is a crucial aspect of programming in Rust, designed to ensure safety and efficiency without the need for a garbage collector.Not having a `garbage collector` is one of the key reasons rust is so fast

It achieves this using the

2. Heap and Stack
    
3. Ownership model
    
4. Borrowing and references
    
5. Lifetimes
